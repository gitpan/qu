NAME
       qu - display quota usage statistics

SYNOPSIS
       qu [--options] [directory ...]

DESCRIPTION
       qu utility displays the file system block usage for each
       directory in the file hierarchy rooted in each directory
       argument. If no directory is specified, the block usage of
       the hierarchy rooted in the current directory usage is
       displayed. Usage is only calculated for files and
       directories owned by the process owner (i.e., you), making
       this useful for calculating real quota usage (hence qu).

       You may view statistics for multiple, disjointed file
       hierarchies by specifying multiple directory arguments.
       You may also specify a variety of command-line arguments
       to alter the output of qu. See the section on OPTIONS.

See qu(1) for more options.

INSTALLATION
       To install, do this:
       
       perl Makefile.PL
       make
       make test
       make install

       To avoid writing to the perllocal.pod file, do 'make
       pure_install' instead of 'make install'.
